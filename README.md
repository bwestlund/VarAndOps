##Inserting the code:
```html
center
<body>
    <script>
        // Your JavaScript goes here!
        console.log("Hello, World!")
        // Right click on the blank page to inspect the console
    </script>
</body>
```
To view the console log, right click the empty screen and inspect->console tab.

### Using an external Java Script file
Alternatively to `<script></script>` your code can be linked to the html file similarly to the CSS styles.css
with 
```html
<script src="javascript.js"></script>
```

Typically this is used when you want to manage a large code base outside of the standard html document.
